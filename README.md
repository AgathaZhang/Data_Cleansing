# Data cleansing of co-ordinate data
For reference

This is a data processor of cleaning and refining raw data to improve its quality and accuracy.
    
The raw data is a set of log text containing three dimensional coordinate points.

This contains the original log data that needs to be cleaned, and I hope that some of the processing methods of the algorithm can be shared with you.
